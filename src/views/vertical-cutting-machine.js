                <span>
                  The vertical foam cutting machine consists of the following
                  parts:
                </span>
                <br className="vertical-cutting-machine-text13"></br>
                <br className="vertical-cutting-machine-text14"></br>
                <span className="vertical-cutting-machine-text15">
                  This machine consists of main components such as the frame,
                  base, working table guide mechanism, mobile positioning plate,
                  motor drive mechanism, blade tension adjustment mechanism,
                  blade wheel mechanism, blade sharpening grinding wheel
                  mechanism, and blade wheel safety cover.
                </span>
                <br className="vertical-cutting-machine-text16"></br>
                <br className="vertical-cutting-machine-text17"></br>
                <span className="vertical-cutting-machine-text18">
                  The frame and base are constructed from welded steel sections,
                  and the blade wheel mechanism is installed on the same plane
                  as these components. To ensure the stability of the blade
                  wheels, they undergo static balance tests before being fixed
                  to this part, and they should not be repositioned once
                  installed and calibrated.
                </span>
                <br className="vertical-cutting-machine-text19"></br>

                <span className="vertical-cutting-machine-text21">
                  The working table is composed of a square frame and aluminum
                  composite panels, with a mobile positioning plate on top. It
                  moves along the longitudinal guide rails, enabling the cutting
                  motion to advance and retreat. The mobile positioning plate is
                  responsible for controlling the cutting thickness.

                <span className="vertical-cutting-machine-text24">
                  The blade tension adjustment mechanism is used to adjust the
                  tension of the blade and to facilitate the installation and
                  removal of the blade. When in use, it is used in conjunction
                  with the spring-tightening nut in this component, which allows
                  for adjusting the tension of the spring.

                <span className="vertical-cutting-machine-text27">
                  The blade sharpening grinding wheel consists of two opposing
                  bowl-shaped grinding wheels driven by an electric motor. They
                  gently touch the blade edge and are fixed after a certain
                  angle offset, which can be selected by the operator, typically
                  ranging from 15° to 30°.

                <span className="vertical-cutting-machine-text30">
                  Regarding the installation and removal of the blade, there are
                  chain-link mechanisms located on the front and rear sides of
                  the working table. These mechanisms serve both as a connection
                  between the left and right platforms and as a means for
                  disassembling and assembling the blade when a new one needs to
                  be replaced. To change the blade, one must first detach these
                  chain-link mechanisms before removing the blade.

                <span className="vertical-cutting-machine-text33">
                  To ensure proper blade positioning, the blade wheels are
                  installed on the same plane during the installation to prevent
                  the blade from slipping or deviating during operation. To
                  prevent radial blade movement, a set of bearings is installed
                  under the top beam to support the blade wheel shaft, and an
                  identical set of bearings is installed in the base (under the
                  working table) to assist in blade positioning.
